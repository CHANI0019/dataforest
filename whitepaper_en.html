                    <h2>1. Abstract</h2>
                    <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI), the engine of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, cannot operate
                        without the fuel of data. However, the current data market is monopolized by a few large
                        corporations, and individuals, the actual producers of data, are not fairly compensated for
                        their contributions. <strong>Data Forest</strong> is a Web 3.0-based decentralized data
                        crowdsourcing platform created to solve this centralized data monopoly. By combining blockchain
                        technology and gamification mechanisms, we aim to build a new data economy ecosystem where
                        anyone in the world can contribute to AI advancement and receive transparent and fair rewards.
                        This whitepaper explains the vision of Data Forest, its technical implementation, and its token
                        economy model centered around the DCT (Data Contribution Token).</p>

                    <h2>2. Introduction: The Data Dilemma and a New Opportunity</h2>
                    <p>We produce a vast amount of data through our smartphones every day, yet the ownership of that
                        data and the economic value it generates mostly belong to the platform companies we use. This
                        <strong>'Data Paradox'</strong> creates several serious problems:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Value Imbalance:</strong> Individuals, the primary producers of data, are excluded
                            from compensation, while centralized platforms monopolize enormous profits.</li>
                        <li><strong>Data Bias:</strong> Data used for training AI models is often collected in
                            controlled environments and fails to reflect the diversity of the real world. This is a
                            major cause of compromised fairness and accuracy in AI models.</li>
                        <li><strong>Lack of Motivation:</strong> For individuals, data collection and labeling are
                            perceived as unrewarded, tedious labor, which limits the large-scale acquisition of
                            high-quality data.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>We believe that blockchain technology is the key to solving these problems and returning
                        <strong>Data Sovereignty</strong> to individuals.</p>

                    <h2>3. Solution: The Data Forest Ecosystem</h2>
                    <p>Data Forest transforms the act of 'data collection' into an enjoyable experience of 'exploring
                        and growing a forest.' Users participate in data collection missions through a mobile app and
                        earn DCT tokens as a reward for their contributions, allowing them to grow their own 'Data
                        Forest'.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Gamified Experience:</strong> Users complete missions to earn experience points
                            (EXP) and level up. Higher levels provide opportunities to participate in rarer and more
                            rewarding missions.</li>
                        <li><strong>Transparent and Immediate Rewards:</strong> All data submission, verification, and
                            reward processes are recorded on a smart contract, making them immutable. Participants can
                            transparently check and receive their rewards instantly.</li>
                        <li><strong>High-Quality Real-World Data:</strong> All data is collected exclusively through the
                            in-app camera, with GPS and time information recorded at the moment of capture. This ensures
                            the provenance and reliability of the data, contributing decisively to reducing AI model
                            bias.</li>
                        <li><strong>Data Marketplace:</strong> Enterprises and developers can purchase specific
                            categories of data needed for AI training at a reasonable cost using DCT tokens in the Data
                            Forest marketplace.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>4. Core Technology & Architecture</h2>
                    <p>Data Forest is built on a proven, modern technology stack to ensure stability and scalability.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Mobile Platform:</strong> We provide a high-performance cross-platform app
                            supporting both iOS and Android environments using Flutter.</li>
                        <li><strong>Backend:</strong> Adopting a Microservices Architecture (MSA), each function (user,
                            mission, reward, etc.) can be developed and scaled independently. The entire infrastructure
                            runs on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) to ensure high availability.</li>
                        <li><strong>Blockchain:</strong> Initially, we will adopt <strong>Polygon (MATIC)</strong> as
                            the main network, known for its low gas fees and high transaction speed, to lower the entry
                            barrier for users. All token issuance and reward distributions are automated through smart
                            contracts written in Solidity.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>5. Tokenomics: The DCT (Data Contribution Token) Economic Model</h2>
                    <p>DCT is a utility token that serves as the lifeblood of the Data Forest ecosystem.</p>
                    <h4>Token Information</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Name:</strong> Data Contribution Token</li>
                        <li><strong>Symbol:</strong> DCT</li>
                        <li><strong>Blockchain:</strong> Polygon (ERC-20)</li>
                        <li><strong>Total Supply:</strong> 100,000,000,000 DCT (100 Billion)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>DCT Utility</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Ecosystem Rewards:</strong> Paid as a reward for all contributions to the ecosystem,
                            such as data collection, verification, and referrals.</li>
                        <li><strong>Data Purchase Medium:</strong> Enterprise clients must use DCT to purchase AI
                            training data from the marketplace.</li>
                        <li><strong>Platform Fees:</strong> Fees incurred from data transactions are paid in DCT. (A
                            portion of the fees will be burned to help stabilize the token's value).</li>
                        <li><strong>Governance (Future):</strong> DCT holders will have voting rights on major platform
                            policy decisions (e.g., new mission categories, fee rates).</li>
                        <li><strong>Staking (Future):</strong> Users can stake DCT to receive additional interest
                            rewards or gain priority access to higher-level missions.</li>
                    </ul>
